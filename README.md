# DPCGAN and differential privacy
This repository illustrates the article Membership Inference Attacks and Differential Privacy: a study within the context of Generative Models.

## Structure

The structure of this repo consists of some presaved results and the code. The code is stored in src folder and consists of two main scripts and several folders with dedicated codes.

## Run the code
Tu run the code, first create a virtual environment and install the requirements. Once this is done, the two entrypoints denoted as estimate_epsilon.py and generate_image_table.py will run the simulation of the DPCGAN targeting Fashion-MNIST dataset.
